### User guide

You can include Marzipano in your project in two different ways:

* Obtain the `marzipano.js` and `marzipano.swf` files from the latest release
  at http://www.marzipano.net and copy them into your project.

* Install Marzipano as a dependency using the `npm` package manager and
  `require` it as a module.

### Developer guide

This is an `npm`-based project.
A [http://www.nodejs.org](Node.js) installation is required for development.
You also need a Java compiler to build the SWF file with the Flash renderers.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. If you haven't in a while,
bring them up to date with `npm update`.

While this script is running, the demos are live-reloaded whenever the source
files are edited.

Run `npm run test` to serve the browser-based test suite at `http://localhost:7357`.
While this script is running, the test suite is live-reloaded whenever the
source or test files are edited.

### Maintainer guide

with `git tag vX.Y.Z`.
